## This course mainly focus on the following modules:
   -Create a document retrieval system using *k-nearest neighbors*.
   
   -Identify various *similarity metrics* for text data.
   
   -Reduce computations in k-nearest neighbor search by using *KD-trees*.
   
   -Produce approximate nearest neighbors using *locality sensitive hashing*.
   
   -Compare and contrast supervised and unsupervised learning tasks.
   
   -Cluster documents by topic using *k-means**.
   
   -Describe how to parallelize k-means using *MapReduce*.
   
   -Examine probabilistic clustering approaches using *mixtures models*.
   
   -Fit a mixture of Gaussian model using *expectation maximization* (EM).
   
   -Perform mixed membership modeling using *latent Dirichlet allocation* (LDA).
   
   -Describe the steps of a *Gibbs sampler* and how to use its output to draw inferences.
   
   -Compare and contrast initialization techniques for non-convex optimization objectives.
